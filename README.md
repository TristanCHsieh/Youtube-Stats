# Youtube-Stats

Youtube Stats is a website that catalogues a selection of playlists, channels, and videos into one interface. Creating the website involved working in multiple scripts such as HTML, JavaScript, SQL, CSS, and JSON. The website was created in a group of five, with each member being assigned different aspects of the project such as creating CSS files, gathering info, and designing a search feature that allows users to search through the sites content.
